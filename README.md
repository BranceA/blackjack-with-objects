# blackjack-with-objects

A reddit post from the explain it like I'm five subreddit was shared with me a while ago that explained Object Oriented Programming.
It was described by breaking down what objects would be needed and the properties and methods that the objects would have to make the game blackjack. 
I thought it was a great way to introduce OOP so I made a quick version staying mostly true to how the post set up the objects.
